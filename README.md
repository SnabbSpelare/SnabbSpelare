2025 Update

I'm someone who likes to mess around in programs and find new settings. Configuring stuff is my stuff, man!
I have real hobbies like making animations in SFM and trying to figure out how to model recently. But I'm most famous about my map named Hidden Doors. Totally the most sucessful map in the history of Garry's Mod! But that was just the first map I made. I've made new maps and refined them so many times I forget what is the story behind them sometimes... I really hope to finish a RP map me and my buggy has been trying to get to finishing ever since I started mapping but it has never really worked out. We both are way more talented now and ARE ready for the challange! (Though we get bored and tired of doing the same things over and over, but still... its a work in progress...)

No closing arguments.
