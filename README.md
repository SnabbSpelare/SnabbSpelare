👋 Hey there! I'm @SnabbSpelare, and I'm all about bringing my creative ideas to life through coding and content creation.

🧠 Always Learning: As I tinker with GMod addons and gradually dive into coding, I'm constantly learning and expanding my knowledge.

🎮 Gaming Enthusiast: I'm passionate about coding scripts for TF2 and GMod, as well as pushing my skills in Rainbow Six Siege. I'm also deep into video editing and love experimenting with game configurations and benchmarking graphical settings.

🎬 Creative Explorer: My interests extend to creating small movies, mapping, and video editing. I'm currently exploring Source Hammer and Source Filmmaker to level up my skills.

🐾 Animal Admirer: Beyond coding and gaming, I'm captivated by the natural beauty of animals like foxes and feline cats. Felines and foxes have a special place in my heart, adding a touch of nature's charm to our beautiful planet.

🍫 Candy Philosophy: "Twix or Snickers? How about both!" Just like coding, life is all about balance and enjoying the best of both worlds.

⚙️ Technical Optimizer: I thrive on optimizing addons, code, and even Windows to be more efficient. Performance matters to me, and so does the environment – our world is our last earth.

💡 Open-Minded Learner: I value transparency and sharing thoughts openly, while also respecting the importance of privacy. Learning from my mistakes is key, and I embrace others' ideas to constantly improve my own. I'm always here to help when I have the time.

🔧 Tweaks and Advancements: I've got a stash of tricks, from registry tweaks to advanced PowerShell and command prompt scripts. These tools can help you achieve the same advancements and advantages as me!

🌱 GitHub Journey: You'll find a mix of projects on my GitHub – from coding experiments to game-related configurations.

Feel free to connect and explore the journey with me!
