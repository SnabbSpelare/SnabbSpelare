# 2025 Update

**I'm someone who likes to mess around in programs and find new settings. Configuring stuff is my stuff, man!**

I have real hobbies like making animations in SFM but working to animate properly has been proven to take more than it seemed in the begining... And also getting into modeling recently which seems fun on **the surface** *;)*. ***But I'm most famous about my map named Hidden Doors.***

***Totally the most sucessful map in the history of Garry's Mod!*** But that was just the first map I made. I've made new maps and refined them so many times I forget why... do i make them sometimes. I really hope to finish a RP map me and my buggy (buddy/friend) has been trying to get to finishing ever since he made it for me. But he stopped working on it so I started learning how to map on my own and realized it was actually more fun than I anticipated! Thank god he was so sloppy and horrendous then and **still to this day** he is like that... he calls it "***speedbuilding***" but its more like bug-building!!! haha! ... anyway that was the point and reason I started mapping but it really hasn't worked out for me. I've made new maps ever since and was most activate the first two to three years (2021-2023), in making constant flood of new maps. But now I'm a bit dizzy so I just stick with the ones I made and aim to publish them all before 2027-ish. But back to topic with the RP map, which I won't leak: we both are way more skilled and so called *'talented'* that I think we ARE ready... but... we get bored and tired of doing the same things over and over, but still... its a work in progress...

if you see code i made its 90% AI mode or its something simple like CMD scripting which is the only thing I know how to script or code if you even can call it that!
